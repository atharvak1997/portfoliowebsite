Hi, my name is Atharva, and I'm a computer science graduate student graduating this June. I'm passionate about making a positive impact in people's lives, and I've done that by leading a startup that helped over 200 Covid patients with a mobile application I developed.
Currently, I'm working with SCU to develop a mobile application that will help 1500+ children across North and South America. During my internship at Onsemiconductors, I developed automated testing tools to increase software testers' productivity, using Jenkins to build and automate tests and SonarQube to check for duplicate code.
My experiences have taught me the importance of creativity, enthusiasm, and a can-do attitude when it comes to solving real-life problems. I'm excited to bring these qualities to any project I work on and to continue making a meaningful impact in people's lives.
